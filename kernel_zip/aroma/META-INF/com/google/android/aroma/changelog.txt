• Upstream Linux Kernel from 4.4.288 to 4.4.302 (latest and last upstream from Linux).

• Implemented EurekaSound (ESOUND) v1.0, a basic headphone audio controller (For AOSP only).

• Implemented Eureka Display Control (EKCAL) which is based on Samsung mDNIE driver (Not available for A20e).

• Modified DT2W driver for A20 and A40 so as to fix DT2W issue on AOSP ROMs.

• Fixed all remaining warnings in kernel source.

• For permissive selinux, SElinux can be switched to enforcing after boot.

• Further improvements to SElinux code to fix some warnings in kernel log.

• Fixed custom flashlight controller for A10.

• Updated WireGuard VPN driver to latest version (1.0.20211208)

• Merged 98 % audio and camera changes from R kernel source into Q/R/S kernels.

• AROMA Installer is now used to facilitate the installation of Eureka Kernel.

• OneUI and AOSP kernels & custom DTBs have been merged into 1 zip (kept size as small as possible).

• Switched to Vortex Clang which is based on the latest version of Clang 14 (20220201).

• Updated to latest A305F kernel source (A305FDDU6CUI3).

• Updated all DTBOs to match latest changes from R source.

• Fixed issue of glitched video renderings on social media apps (E.g: Instagram).

• Two kernel versions with different schedulers are now available:
    • Implemented EMS (Exynos Mobile Scheduler) which is a scheduler based on EAS (Energy Aware Scheduling).
    • The normal kernel version has the stock HMP (Heterogeneous Multi-Processing) scheduler.

• Eureka kernel R9.0 heavily depends on DTB (not DTBO) for the following features:
    • CPU and GPU overclock & underclock
    • SELinux state (enforcing or permissive)
    • Sound driver compatibility (AOSP, OneUI2 or OneUI3)
    • Energy model and parameters for EMS kernels

• EMS kernel works best with schedutil based governors. The following governors were added:
    • Blu Schedutil
    • ElectroUtilX
    • PwrUtilX

• Updated spectrum files.

• Other minor changes.
